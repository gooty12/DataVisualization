## About
In this project we made visualizations by which we will be able to see a trend in Olympics over the years. This will include medals won by countries, country ranking, men/women ratio, host nation performance. Overall, we can infer from the designs what the trend is and will be worth reckoning to know in detail. Our goal is to make visualizations synchronized with each other so that itâ€™s easy to deduce the learning from it.
